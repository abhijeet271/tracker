#  How does Codespaces work?
A codespace is a development environment that's hosted in the cloud. You can customize your project for GitHub Codespaces by configuring dev container files to your repository (often known as Configuration-as-Code), which creates a repeatable codespace configuration for all users of your project.

- Codespaces is available for teams and companies, but needs to be enabled first in an organizationâ€™s settings. Teams and companies are able to select which repositories and users have access to Codespaces for added security and permissioning control.

# What we can do with Codespaces?

   1)Code from any device
   
   2)Onboard at the speed of light

3)Model, train, and analyze data

4)Fix bugs right from a pull request
